# Class Design

- make data *private*
- make getter + setter method for data
- always initialize data

# Inheritance Relationship

- "Is a" relationship
- *extends*

# Association Relationship

- "Has a" relationship
- a class object contains an object of another class

# Visibility Modifiers

- protected - visible to packages and all subclasses
- Private - visible to class only
- no modifier - visiable to the package
